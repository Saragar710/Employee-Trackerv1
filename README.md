# Employee-Trackerv1
  
## Description

This app is very useful. It was a bit difficult to create, but once I got the hang of it, it all came together.  A company can use this program to keep an organized database of not only their employees, but also their roles, salarys, departments and who their immediate manager is.


## Installation

This app has all the dependencies already installed. Simply run the command node server.js and the app will kick off. 

## Usage

Once the app is running you will follow the prompts to view all employees, departments and roles. You will also be able to add a department with an employee and their manager.
